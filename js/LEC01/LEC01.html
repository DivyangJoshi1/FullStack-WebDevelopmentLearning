    <!-- Javascript can be used for frontend and also for backend. Here we are going to learn how it will be use for frontend. 
    We can add javascript in two ways. internal js and external js.
    we can add js as internal by adding script tag before body closing.
    and for external js we can create .js file and write code of js there and link it in our html file by writing script:src and entering file name.  -->
    <div class="box">
        Hey , I am Box.
    </div>
    <button>Submit</button>

    <!-- <script>alert("Hello world")</script>-->

    <script src="LEC01.js"></script>

    <!-- Installation of Node.Js
    Install from official website.
    Open terminal and write "node --version" 
    it shows v20.14.0 (Latest version of NodeJs.
    it means node is successully installed in your device.)
    
    What is NodeJs : 
    Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, outside of a web browser. It enables developers to build scalable and high-performance network applications using JavaScript.
    NodeJs is basically v8 engine of JavaScript that is use by Chrome to run our script.
    when we use javascript for backend we can run it by nodejs.
    to run js in backend write "node filename.js" in terminal.
    
    for checking version of npm write : "npm --version."-->

    <!-- we can also change style of website using js. it change inline css for it. check js file for it. -->
