    <!--How to add video in our website ?
    Syntax:<video src=""> </video> 
    we can also add external video url in src. 

    Attributes of video tag : 

    (1)controls : In HTML, the controls attribute is used within the <video> element to display standard video controls to the user.
    When you include the controls attribute in a <video> tag, it adds a set of controls to the video player interface,
    allowing users to play, pause, adjust volume, seek, and view video progress.
    We can download video , set video speed and quality etc.

    (2)Width and Height : We can Adjust Height and Width of a Video

    (3)AutoPlay : The autoplay attribute in the <video> tag in HTML automatically starts playing the video as soon as the page loads.
    <video src="COSTA RICA IN 4K 60fps HDR (ULTRA HD).mp4" width="1200" controls autoplay></video>
        
    (4)loop : The loop attribute in the <video> tag in HTML enables the video to replay continuously in a loop after it ends.
    <video src="COSTA RICA IN 4K 60fps HDR (ULTRA HD).mp4" width="1200" loop></video>
    
    (5)muted : The muted attribute in the <video> tag in HTML automatically mutes the audio of the video.
    <video src="COSTA RICA IN 4K 60fps HDR (ULTRA HD).mp4" width="1200" muted></video>-->
    
    <video src="COSTA RICA IN 4K 60fps HDR (ULTRA HD).mp4" width="1200" controls></video>

    <!--Important Attribute : poster
    It is used to show an image while the video is downloading or until the user clicks to play
    <video src="COSTA RICA IN 4K 60fps HDR (ULTRA HD).mp4" width="1200" controls poster="example.avif"></video>-->

    <br>

    <audio src="rainy-day-in-town-with-birds-singing-194011.mp3" controls></audio>

    <!--Almost same attribute as video
    
    Important Attribute : preload
    preload: Specifies if and how the audio should be loaded when the page loads ('auto', 'metadata', 'none').
    The "preload" attribute can have the following values:

    none: This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio file at all.
    The audio file will only start downloading when the user initiates playback.

    metadata: This value tells the browser to preload only the metadata of the audio file,
    such as its duration and basic information about the audio. This can be useful if you want to display the audio duration to the user without fully loading the audio data.

    auto: This value instructs the browser to preload the entire audio file as much as possible without delaying the loading of other important page content.
    The browser will try to load the audio file in the background so that it's ready to play when the user decides to start it.-->

    <!--What is SVG ?
    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
    Unlike raster images like PNGs or JPGs, SVGs are not pixel-based.
    They're composed of vectorsâ€”mathematical formulas that describe shapes, paths, and fills.
    This means SVGs can be resized without losing quality.
