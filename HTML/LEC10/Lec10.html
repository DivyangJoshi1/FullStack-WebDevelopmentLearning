    <!--All about Quatation tag
    The use of quotations is common in textual content.
    HTML provides specific tags to handle this: <blockquote> for block quotations and <q> for inline quotations.
    we'll explore these tags, their attributes, and how to style them.

    What Are <blockquote> and <q> Tags?
    The <blockquote> and <q> tags serve to define quotations in HTML. 
    While <blockquote> is used for longer, block-level quotes, <q> is used for shorter, inline quotes.
        
    Why Use These Tags?
    They provide semantic meaning to your quotations, making it easier for search engines to understand the context and relevance of the content.-->

    <blockquote cite="source-url">
        Quotation text here.
    </blockquote>

    <q cite="source-url">Quotation text here.</q>
