    <!--Already mentioned about what is SEO in above lectures
    Now Question is that what is CLS ? 

    CLS Stands for Cumulative Layout Shift : 
        Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a stable Core Web Vital metric. 
        It's an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. 
        A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful.
        Unexpected layout shifts can disrupt the user experience in many ways,
        from causing them to lose their place while reading if the text moves suddenly
        to making them click the wrong link or button. In some cases, this can do serious damage.
        To provide a good user experience, a site must have a CLS score of 0.1 or less-->

    <!-- What is LCP ? 
    LCP Stands for Largest Contentful Paint
    LCP reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible in the viewport, relative to when the user first navigated to the page.
    To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have LCP of 2.5 seconds or less.
    To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.-->

    <!--What is FID ?
    FID Stands for first Input Delay.
    FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page 
    (that is, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) 
    to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.
    To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Input Delay of 100 milliseconds or less.
