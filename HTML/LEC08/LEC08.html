    A block element in HTML occupies the full width available and starts on a new line.
    The <p> tag in HTML represents a block element, meaning it creates a paragraph of text that starts on a new line and occupies the full width available.-->
    
    <!--What is inline element?

    The <span> tag in HTML represents an inline element, meaning it does not start on a new line and flows within the content.-->
