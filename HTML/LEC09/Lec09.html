    <h3>Ids and Classes Tutorial</h3>

    <!-- What is id in html ?
    When a child is born, we give them a name, which we use to identify them. 
    Similarly, in HTML, the id attribute is utilized to assign a unique identifier to an element within a document.
    This identifier, like the id attribute "mainBox" in the provided <div>, is exclusive to the element it is applied to.
    Each id name is unique within the document and cannot be used for multiple elements.
    The id attribute allows us to target specific elements in JavaScript for content manipulation or additional functionality.
    Additionally, in CSS, the id attribute facilitates the application of styles to the designated element.
    Thus, the id attribute plays a crucial role in precisely identifying and interacting with individual elements in HTML.-->

    <!-- What is class in html ?
        In the provided HTML snippet, the <div> element is assigned the id attribute "mainBox" and the class attribute "redBg blackBorder".
    This id serves as a unique identifier for the <div> element within the document, akin to a person's distinct name.
    The class attribute, like the "redBg" class applied to the <span> element, allows multiple elements to share common styling or functionality.
    Each class can be applied to multiple elements, unlike the id attribute, and it serves as a collective identifier for those elements.
    In JavaScript, classes can be targeted to manipulate content or functionality shared among elements.
    Similarly, in CSS, classes enable the application of styles to all elements with the same class, enhancing visual consistency.
    Therefore, while the id attribute uniquely identifies a single element, the class attribute facilitates the grouping and styling of multiple elements with shared characteristics.-->

    <div id="mainBox" class="redBg blackBorder ">
        This is mainBox
    </div>
    <span class="redBg"></span>

    <!-- what is Emmet-->

    <!--Emmet provides functionality to write html code in a faster way.
    In Emmet, when I write span.redBg, it creates a <span> tag with the class "redBg".
    Similarly, when I write span#mainSpan, it creates a <span> tag with the id "mainSpan".
    In this notation, the period (".") is used for specifying a class, and the pound sign ("#") is used for specifying an id.
    I wrote span.redBg.BlackBorder.AnotherClass then it creates span tag with all these class as mentioned below-->

    <span class="redBg"></span>
    <span id="mainSpain"></span>
    <span class="redBg BlackBorder AnotherClass"></span>

    <!--Emmet takes div as default.-->

    <div class="redBg">
        <!--Like here i wrote .redBg then it creates div with class redBg-->
    </div>

    <!--Create multiple elements using emmet-->
    <!--span.myClass.myClass2.myClass3 + tab-->
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3"></span>
    
    <!--span.myClass.myClass2.myClass3*3 + tab to print 4 similar elements using emmet-->
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">First</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Second</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Third</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Fourth</span>
