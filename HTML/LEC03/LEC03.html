    <!--Information about bold and italic tag: 
    Basic syntax: <b></b> 
                  <i></i>
    Note : In HTML, the <b> and <i> tags were traditionally used for bold and italic text styling, respectively. 
    However, with the introduction of HTML5, it is now considered better practice to use semantic markup for emphasis and styling, 
    such as <strong> for strong importance (often displayed as bold) and <em> for emphasis (often displayed as italics). 
    This shift encourages more meaningful and accessible markup, enhancing the structure and clarity of web content.
    Example below how to use bold and italic tag.-->

    <b>This is a bold content</b><br>
    <i>This is a italic content</i>

    <!--Useful shortcut: ctrl + enter to jump into the new line-->
