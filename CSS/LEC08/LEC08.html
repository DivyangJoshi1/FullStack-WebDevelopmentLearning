        /* The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex. */

              margin: 0;
              padding: 0;

            /* The display: inline; and display: inline-block; properties in CSS control how an element is displayed on the page. Here are the key differences between them:

            display: inline : 

            No Block Formatting Context: Elements with display: inline; do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They flow with the surrounding text.
            Width and Height: You cannot set the width or height properties on inline elements. Any width and height values are ignored.
            Padding and Margin: Only horizontal padding and margin (left and right) have any effect. Vertical padding and margin (top and bottom) do not push other elements away.

            display: inline-block: 

            Block Formatting Context in Inline Flow: Elements with display: inline-block; are similar to inline elements in that they do not start on a new line, but they behave like block elements in that you can set their width and height.
            Width and Height: You can set the width and height properties on inline-block elements, and they will be respected.
            Padding and Margin: All padding and margin values (top, right, bottom, left) are respected and can push other elements away.
            Align with Text: Inline-block elements align with the surrounding text like inline elements, allowing them to sit next to each other or text content. */

              display: inline-block;
              padding: 45px;
              margin: 35px;

              
            }

            .Box1{
                width: 346px;
                /* display: none; */
                /* visibility: hidden; */

                /* display: none; completely removes an element from the document flow, making it take up no space on the page, while visibility: hidden; hides the element but still maintains its space in the layout. Neither property allows interaction with the hidden element. */

                /* display: flex; is a CSS property that creates a flexible container for its child elements, allowing for easy alignment and distribution of space within the container using the Flexbox layout model.
                
                display: flex; justify-content: center; is used to create a flex container that centers its child elements horizontally within the container. This makes it easy to align items in the middle of the container.*/

                display: flex;
                /* display: inline-flex; */
                justify-content: center;
