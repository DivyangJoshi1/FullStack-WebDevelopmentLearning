React Application Development Steps

1. Understanding Props
Props are properties passed to components to render dynamic content.
Example: Passing TextUtils and About components as props and rendering them.

2. Creating a New Component: TextForm
Naming convention for clarity (TextForm.js for a form handling text).
Form Setup:
Use Bootstrap for quick form creation.
Adjust necessary attributes (class to className, for to htmlFor).

3. Incorporating TextForm Component
Place the TextForm component within the main app layout.
Import TextForm in App.js and render it after Navbar.

4. Props for TextForm Component
Pass a heading prop to TextForm.
Render prop in TextForm using {props.heading}.

5. Bootstrap Container and Form Adjustments
Use div.container for Bootstrap styling.
Adjust form elements:
Set rows for textarea for better visibility.
Change placeholder text to "Enter the text to analyze".

6. Adding Buttons for Text Manipulation
Example button: "Convert to Uppercase".
Add multiple buttons for different text transformations.

7. Handling Events
Use onClick event to trigger functions on button clicks.

8. State Management with Hooks
State: Represents the current status of the component.
Use useState hook to manage state.
Syntax: const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)
Example:
const [text, setText] = useState('Enter text here');

9. Updating State on Event
Use setText to update the text state.
Handle form input changes with onChange:
Function: handleOnChange.
Update state: setText(event.target.value).

10. Event Handlers
handleUpClick: Converts text to uppercase.
Example implementation:
const handleUpClick = () => {
  let newText = text.toUpperCase();
  setText(newText);
};
handleOnChange: Updates text state on input change.
Example implementation:
const handleOnChange = (event) => {
  setText(event.target.value);
};

11. Cleaning Up Console Logs
Remove unnecessary console.log statements to keep the console clean.

12. Summary of Concepts
Props: Pass data to components.
State Management: Use useState to create and update state variables.
Event Handling: Use event handlers (onClick, onChange) to interact with components.
Hooks: Functions like useState to use React features in functional components.
