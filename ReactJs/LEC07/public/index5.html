React Components and Props

Introduction to Components:

->Components: Building blocks of a React application, allowing you to split the UI into reusable pieces.
->File Organization: Place custom components in a dedicated components folder for better organization.

Creating a Function-Based Component (RFC):
->RFCs are the most common and straightforward way to write components in React.
->Naming Convention: Always start component names with a capital letter (e.g., Navbar.js).
->Function Component: Create a component using the rfc snippet.

----------------------------|
Code:                       |
import React from 'react';  |
                            |
const Navbar = () => {      |
  return (                  |
    <div>                   |
      Hello, I am a Navbar  |
    </div>                  |
  );                        |
}                           |
-----------------------------

export default Navbar;

now , Using Components: Import and use components in App.js

Code:
import Navbar from './components/Navbar';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Navbar />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Purpose of Components: Keep the codebase clean and organized by separating different parts of the UI into individual components.

---
Using Props in Components :
->Props: Short for properties, used to pass data from parent to child components.
->Passing Props: Pass props to a component like attributes in HTML

Code:
<Navbar title="TextUtils" />

Accessing Props: Receive and use props within the component.

Code:
const Navbar = (props) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
    </nav>
  );
}
export default Navbar;


Example with Multiple Props
Passing Multiple Props: Pass multiple pieces of data as props.

Code:
<Navbar title="TextUtils" aboutText="About TextUtils" />

Using Multiple Props: Access and use multiple props in the component.

Code:
const Navbar = (props) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.aboutText}</p>
    </nav>
  );
}

export default Navbar;

Understanding Props:
->Purpose of Props: Allow components to be dynamic and reusable by passing different data.
->Analogy: A blank paper (component) becomes useful (application) when filled with specific information (props).
->Imp note: props are read only


-------------------------------
PropTypes in React:
->Purpose: PropTypes help catch bugs by validating the types of props passed to a component.
->Installation: Ensure PropTypes is installed.

Code:
npm install prop-types


Importing PropTypes: Import PropTypes at the beginning of your component file.

Code:
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

Defining PropTypes
->Setting PropTypes: Define PropTypes for your component to specify the expected type of each prop.

Code:
Navbar.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string,
  aboutText: PropTypes.string
};

Example with Multiple Props:
Passing Multiple Props: Pass multiple pieces of data as props

Code:
<Navbar title="TextUtils" aboutText="About TextUtils" />

Using Multiple Props: Access and use multiple props in the component

Code:
const Navbar = (props) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.aboutText}</p>
    </nav>
  );
}

export default Navbar;

Concept of : Handling Invalid Props

Invalid Prop Warning: If a prop of the wrong type is passed, React will log a warning.

Example code:
<Navbar title={3} /> // Warning: Failed prop type

Concept of Default Props:
Setting Default Props: Provide default values for props if none are passed

Example code:
Navbar.defaultProps = {
  title: "Set Title Here",
  aboutText: "About Text Here"
};

Usage: If props are not provided, default values will be used

Code:
<Navbar /> // Uses defaultProps

Concept of PropTypes with isRequired:
Marking Props as Required: Ensure that certain props are always passed to the component

Code:
Navbar.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  aboutText: PropTypes.string
};

Handling Missing Required Props: If a required prop is not provided, React will log a warning

code:
<Navbar /> // Warning: Failed prop type

Summary
Props: Pass data to components to make them dynamic.
PropTypes: Validate the types of props to catch bugs and ensure correct usage.
DefaultProps: Provide default values for props when none are passed.
isRequired: Ensure essential props are always provided, preventing potential errors.
