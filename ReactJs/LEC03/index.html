<!--Notes :
when we create app using create-react-app , we have to start editing by app.js 

now what is JSX ?
There are two types of components in ReactJs :
(1)Function based Components
(2)Class Based Components 
Earlier Class based components was famous but now a days function  based components are famous because of it's syntax.So now create-react-app use function based components instead of class based components.

you have to write a function, function App And you have to get the return done by putting a bracket,by putting parenthesis, JSX so, whatever is written inside that parenthesis, it is called JSX what is this JSX is it JavaScript, or html see if i have to answer you in very simple language So that would be, I'd say it's all HTML it's HTML who's wearing the crown of JavaScript, ok 
the best feature of jsx is that i can use javascript inside html.now question is that why did the creators of react do it ?
bcz we do not want to keep seperate files of css and js. so for providing a better user experience , it created in a way that we have to keep all in one file.

so now what is difference in this html ?
so basically this entire file is js file(.js extension). so here inside div or any other block class is renamed as "className" and for is renamed as "htmlFor" bcz class and for is reserved word in javascript.

Concept of React.js Fragment ?
In React, a fragment is a way to group a list of children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This can be particularly useful when you need to return multiple elements from a componentâ€™s render method but don't want to create an additional wrapper element like a div or span that might affect the layout or styling of your application.

React provides a Fragment component for this purpose, which can be used in two ways:

(1) Using <React.Fragment>:

import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;


(2)Using the shorthand <> and </>:

import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

In summary, React fragments are a handy feature for grouping multiple children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM, maintaining a cleaner and more efficient structure in your React applications.

in 99% cases, we remove content of jsx because we write our own jsx content

when we want to write javascript content , use {} for it in jsx.

Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls/
it converts it into object like format-->
