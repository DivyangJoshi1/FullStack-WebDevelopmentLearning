<!-- Notes : 
Multi-Page Application:
A request is being sent by the client to the server and in response to this request the HTML, CSS, JS of that specific page is rendered by the server in the client’s device. In Multi-Page Applications, corresponding to every page their HTML, CSS, JS is rendered by the server.  

For example: While visiting codewithharry.com/contact its HTML will be served and while moving to codewithharry.com/about then again its HTML will be served. 

Single Page Application:
In this case, the request will be sent once by the client to the server, and all the HTML, CSS, JS will be rendered with the first request. Then, Javascript will take control of the whole application and with the help of APIs, the same page will be populated. This means that on the new request of the user it will serve the page without reloading it.

Advantages of Single-Page Applications:
By using a single-page Application we can save a lot of bandwidth in the case of those applications which are getting a huge amount of traffic. It provides an improved user experience and also results in quick loading time.

Node module:
It contains all the packages which we needed to develop our React application.

Tip: Whenever we share our application, we make sure that we don’t share the Node_modules folder. This folder can easily be recreated with the help of  Package.json and Package-lock.json by using the npm install command. Due to this reason we put our node_module folder in Gitignore so that we accidentally don’t share it.

Project-1: Creating a TextUtils app:
Description of our app: It is a text document editor. It will contain a Text box in which we will be adding our text.

Some of its features will be:

Word Counting.
Removing Extra spaces.
Capitalizing the text of the document.
Adding Lowercase and uppercase to the text.
Adding Bootstrap to our React App (Textutils):
Bootstrap: It is the framework of CSS. With the help of Bootstrap, you can easily put UI components to your Application. To access Bootstrap click here.

In the Documentation of Bootstrap, we will find the starter template which has two main things for adding bootstrap in our application.

1. Bootstrap bundle with popper: It contains the Jquery files, Bootstrap.js, and popper.js files. Copy the code and paste it inside the body tag of  index.html of your react application.
2. Bootstrap CSS: It contains the CSS files to enhance your application. Copy the code of Bootstrap CSS and add it inside the head tag of index.html( In the Public folder) of your application.
Now we can use the components of Bootstrap in our Application. Open App.js and Remove the Previous content from return(). Let’s begin creating our application.

function app(){
    return(

    );
};

Navbar of our app:
Get the Navbar component from the Bootstrap Component section and paste it inside the return(). Make sure of the following things while doing so:

Close those tags which don't have a closing tag. 
Replace the ‘class’ keyword with ‘ClassName’.
Replace href= “#” with href= “/”
The code must be in one tag or use a JSX fragment.
Editing the Bootstrap component:
You can override the Bootstrap CSS code and replace it with your desired one. You can even delete those components which aren’t required.

Point to remember: Whenever you are building the app for production, you should use the npm run build command instead of npm start to host your application.

for that first write : npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
then it deployed

concept of default export and named export :
In JavaScript, a default export is a way to export a single value or module from a file, making it the "default" export of that file. This allows other modules to import this value or module without having to use the exact name of the exported value.
i have to write mjs extension for it.

ex: i have 1 file module 1.mjs
content: 
const a = "Divyang"
const b = "Rohan"
const c = "Priyanka"
const d = "aakash"

export default d
export {a};
export {b};
export {c};

then i have another file module2.js
content: 
import ui from './module1.mjs'
console.log(ui)
Ans : aakash

import dza,{a,b,c} from './module1.mjs'
console.log(dza)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)

ans : aakash
Rohan
Priyanka

we have to put same name in import while not exporting as default.
